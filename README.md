drill-parser
============

For parsing the marching band drill PDF that we received in the email and converting it into something useful: coordinates!

Uses the ruby gem 'pdf-reader' and some nice tips from [Jonas' weblog](http://blog.peschla.net/2014/04/parsing-pdf-text-with-coordinates-in-ruby/).
